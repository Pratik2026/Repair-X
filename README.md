## Features

- React for building user interfaces
- Vite for fast and efficient development
- Chakra UI for responsive and customizable styling
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for seamless development experience
- ESLint rules for maintaining code quality

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shramanpaul/RepairiX.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd RepairiX
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

   Replace `my-new-feature` with a descriptive name for your feature or bug fix.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.

## Folder Structure

The main files and folders in this template are organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code of the application.
  - `App.jsx`: The main React component that serves as the entry point of the app.
- `index.html`: The HTML file that serves as the entry point of the application.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration file.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this template to suit your project's needs. You can modify the `src/App.jsx` file to create your React components and UI, and use Chakra UI's components for styling. Update the `index.html` file and the Vite configuration in `vite.config.js` as needed.

## Best Practices

- Never force push to a shared branch (`main` or `master`). Instead, create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Use meaningful branch names that reflect the purpose of your changes.
- Regularly pull from the main repository's latest changes to keep your local repository up to date.
